## Overview
Happy Camper helps find interesting things to do on  vacation! When a state is selected, a list of national parks and monuments is displayed for the user. Picking a park opens a second page that shows campgrounds, visitors centers, and other interesting facts about the selected parkm along with a five-day weather forecast.
